A client, which will often be a server send a request to ES cluster over HTTP. The cluster does its magic based on the index and query you specifeied in the request. When the results are ready, the cluster responds with the results.

Let's have a look at what happens when a cluster receives a query.

We have a cluster consisting of 3 nodes and 1 index distributed accross 3 shards. A client sends request to a cluster which ends up on a node `SHARD B`. This node is now so called a coordinating node, meaning that this node is now responsible for sending requests to other nodes, assembling the response and sending it to the client. By default every node in the cluster can be a coordinating node and can receive HTTP requests. Since the node conains the shard which will be searched, the node will perform a query itself. The coordinating then broadcasts a requests to every other node in the index, being either a primary shard or a replica shard.
When each of shards respond with their response, the coordinating node merges them together and sorts them and sends the results to the client.

* a search query hits a given node within the cluster
* this node becomes a coordinating node for the query
* it broadcasts the request to all shards in the index (this can be primary shards or replica shards)
* the shards respond and the coordinating node will merge the results and send the response to the client

The approach is different when you retrieve a single doc by its id. In this case the request is been broadcasted to an appropriate shard, instead of being broadcasted to all shards.
