There are 2 way of running search queries: using a request body and query params

### Query DSL
```
GET /analyzer_test/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "description":  "drinking"
    }
  }
}
```
In this example, match is the query type which then contains a key with the name of the field we search against. 

There are two main groups of queries in the query DSL: **Leaf query** and **Compound Query**
![query_types](https://github.com/konman1989/es-notes/blob/main/images/queries_types.png)

The basic idea is that leaf queries search query within particular fields, when compound queries consist of multiple leaf or compound queries themselves. Compound queries are recursive in their nature. 

```
GET /analyzer_test/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
```

### Query params

```
GET /products/_search?q=tags:Meat and name:Lobster
```
```
GET /products/_search?q=* <- returns everythibg
```
Query DSL also support query string as well:
```
GET /analyzer_test/_search
{
  "query": {
    "query_string": {
      "query":  "name:pasta"
    }
  }
}
```
