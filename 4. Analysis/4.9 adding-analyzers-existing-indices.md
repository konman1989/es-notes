The process is a bit special. We actually have to close the index before adding analyzers and then open up the index afterwards. Closing an index simply means that it will block read and write operations. 
 
```
POST /analyzer_test/_close
```
Response
```
{
  "acknowledged" : true,
  "shards_acknowledged" : true,
  "indices" : {
    "analyzer_test" : {
      "closed" : true
    }
  }
}
```

We'll add a similar analyzer, but only for French

```
PUT /analyzer_test/_settings
{
  "analysis": {
    "analyzer": {
      "french_stop": {
        "type": "standard",
        "stopwords": "_french_"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We have succesfully added a new analyzer, let's open the index
```
POST /analyzer_test/_open
```

Now if we wanted to use this analyzer for an existing mapping, we had no luck because we would have to delete the index first.
