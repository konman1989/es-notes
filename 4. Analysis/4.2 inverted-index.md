## Overview

The results of the anaalysis are stored in an inverted index. The purpose of inverted index is to store text in a structure that allows for very efficient and fast full text searches. When performing full text searches we were actualy quering and inverted index and not the JSON docs we defined when indexing the documents. A cluster will have at least one inverted index. That's because there would be an inverted index for each full text fields per index. 

So if we have an index containing documents that contain five full text fields we will have five inverted indices. Inverted index consists of all of the unique terms that appear in any document covered by the index for each of them. 

So essentially an inverted index is a mapping between terms and whcih documents containt those terms. Since an inverted index works at the document field level and stores the terms of a given field, it does not need to deal with different fields.

If we have a doc containing `the best pasta with pesto recipe`, the index terms will be sorted and look as following:
```
best
pasta
pesto
recipe
the
with
```

Also terms are the result of the analysis process. Inverted index also holds information that is used internally such as for computing relevance. For example, number of documents containing each term, the number of times a term appears in a given document, the averate length of a field etc.

## Summary

Analyzer is applied to full text fields and the results of this analysis process are stored within an inverted index. An inverted index consists of all of the terms for a given field across all documents within an index. So when performing the search query, we are not searching for docs themselves, but rather and inverted index.
