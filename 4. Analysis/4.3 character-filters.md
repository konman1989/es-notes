## Overview

There are only 3 character filters available:
 
* HTML Strip Character Filter (html_strip). Strips out HTML elements like <strong> and decodes HTML entitite like `&amp`; 
* Mapping Character Filter (mapping). Replaces values based on a map of keys and values. You can defiend how certain characters should be replaced by smiley faces as in this example:
 "I broke my leg _sad_ But luckily I have some red wine around _happy" -> "I broke my leg :-( But luckily I have some red wine around _happy :-)"
  You simply specify a map of tokens and their replacements and the the character filter will take care of replacing all of the occurrences with the appropriate replacaments.
* Pattern Replace (pattern_replace) filter uses a regex to match characters and replaces them with the specified replacement.
