## Overview

* prevent overwriting docs inadvertently due to concurrent operations
* scenarios:
  - handling concurrent visitors for a web application
  **Example**
  when we retrieve the product, the current primary term and sequence number are included whithin the results. What we can do is to take the values and add them to the POST request that we send to update the doc. To do that we use the "if_seq_no" and "if_primary_term" parameters. ES will then use these 2 values to ensure that we won't overwrite a doc inadvertently if it has changed since we retrieved it. If that happens, the operation will fail and we can try the process again. 
  
  Take the "\_seq_no" and "\_primary_term" values from the GET response
  
  POST products/_update/100?if_primary_term=1&if_seq_no=14
  
  What this means is that the document will be update only if these 2 values match the ones in the query parameter.
