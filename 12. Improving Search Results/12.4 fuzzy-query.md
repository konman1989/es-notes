## `fuzzy` query

```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "fuzzy": {
      "name": {
        "value": "LOBSTER",
        "fuzziness": "auto"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We get no matches... The reason is that there is a significant difference between the `fuzziness query` and `match query` with a `fuzziness` param. The `match query` is a full text query and a `fuzzy query` is a term level query which means that it is not analyzed. Since we're searching the field that uses an analyzer with a lowercase token fileter, our query does not match. Not only does it not match, but the edit distance required to make the terms mamtch is too high. Other then the fact that query is not analyzed, the fuzziness part of it works exactly the same as match query.

It's quite rare to search fields that are not analyzed with fuzzy queries which is the reason why match query with the fuzziness parameter is usually preferred over the fuzzy query. If we change the above query to the lowercase, we get the same results as with the match query.
