## Adding a test document

```
PUT /highlighting/_doc/1
{
  "description": "Let me tell you a story about Elasticsearch. It's a full-text search engine that is built on Apache Lucene. It's really easy to use, but also packs lots of advanced features that you can use to tweak its searching capabilities. Lots of well-known and established companies use Elasticsearch, and so should you!"
}
```

We can add a `highlight` object. There are 2 different highlighters available which do highlighting in different ways. 

```
GET /highlighting/_search
{
  "_source": false,
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "description": "Elasticsearch story"
    }
  },
  "highlight": {
    "fields": {
      "description": {}
    }
  }
}
```
Response
```
{
  "took" : 5,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 2,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 0.43434912,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "highlighting",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 0.43434912,
        "highlight" : {
          "description" : [
            "Let me tell you a <em>story</em> about <em>Elasticsearch</em>.",
            "Lots of well-known and established companies use <em>Elasticsearch</em>, and so should you!"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
