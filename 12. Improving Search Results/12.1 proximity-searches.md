When searching for phrases, each of the phrases term must appear in exactly that order for a doc to match. That's a pretty strict requirement. We migth want to relax the constraint and allow a number of terms in between the terms in the phrase that we're searching for. When splitting the input into terms, the positions of the terms are also recorded. And these are stored in the inverted index. The phrase that's supplied for the match phrase query is also analyzed. Apart from just ensuring that the doc contains the terms, the query also ensures that they appear in the correct order. For that, it uses the term positions stored in the inverted index which were added when analyzing a given doc. So for a doc to match the phrase "spicy sauce" both of the terms must appear in the field that we are searching. The position of the term "sauce" must also be one greater than the position of the spicy term. If these 2 conditions are met, then the document will match the phrase.

{
  "query": {
    "match_phrase": {
      "title": {
        "query": "spicy sauce"
      }
    }
  }
}

        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

We only got one match, specifically with both of the 2 terms in the correct order. Suppose we want to allow the term in between. We can accommplish this by adding a parameter named `slop`. The value of this param should be an integer representing how far apart the terms are allowed to be while still be considered a match. "How far apart" - means how many times a term may be moved for a doc to match. 

```
GET /proximity/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_phrase": {
      "title": {
        "query": "spicy sauce",
        "slop": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 2,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 0.21585016,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "proximity",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 0.21585016,
        "_source" : {
          "title" : "Spicy Sauce"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "proximity",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "2",
        "_score" : 0.12672737,
        "_source" : {
          "title" : "Spicy Tomato Sauce"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
When we add the `slop` param to the phrase query it's referred to as a proximmity search. How close to terms that we specify in the query are together with matching docs is referred to as proximity. The more we increase the value, the more proximity we achieve.
```
GET /proximity/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_phrase": {
      "title": {
        "query": "spicy sauce",
        "slop": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

    },

        "_source" : {
          "title" : "Spicy Sauce"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "proximity",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "2",
        "_score" : 0.12672737,
        "_source" : {
          "title" : "Spicy Tomato Sauce"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "proximity",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "4",
        "_score" : 0.094962806,
        "_source" : {
          "title" : "Tomato Sauce (spicy)"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

Notice, that in the 3d result the terms are switched. The reason is that when using a `slop` parameter we are allowing a number of moves to be made to terms or more formally we edit distance. As long as the added distance does not exceed the value of the `slop` param, the terms may be arranged in any order.
