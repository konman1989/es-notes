  If we take a look at the previous search results we can see that terms appearing in the initial phrase order are scored the highest. That's because the proximity in which the terms appear affects the relevance scores. The closer the proximity, the higher the relevance scores. 
  
  By default the `match_phrase` querry requests all terms to be present in the order specified. If we don't require all terms to be present because the relevance scoring algorithm favors docs where most of the terms appear anyways. We can do that by using `match` query. But at the same time we might want to boost docs based on the termm proximity which the `match_phrase` query does.

What this means is that in the `must` clause we get all the results that match, but the `should` clause boosts the results.
