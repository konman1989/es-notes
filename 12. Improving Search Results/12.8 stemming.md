## Creating a test index

```
PUT /stemming_test
{
  "settings": {
    "analysis": {
      "filter": {
        "synonym_test": {
          "type": "synonym",
          "synonyms": [
            "firm => company",
            "love, enjoy"
          ]
        },
        "stemmer_test" : {
          "type" : "stemmer",
          "name" : "english"
        }
      },
      "analyzer": {
        "my_analyzer": {
          "tokenizer": "standard",
          "filter": [
            "lowercase",
            "synonym_test",
            "stemmer_test"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "description": {
        "type": "text",
        "analyzer": "my_analyzer"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Adding a test document

```
PUT /stemming_test/_doc/1
{
  "description": "I love working for my firm!"
}
```
```
GET /stemming_test/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "description": "enjoy work"
    }
  }
}
```
Response
```
{
  "took" : 2,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 0.7176595,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "stemming_test",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 0.7176595,
        "_source" : {
          "description" : "I love working for my firm!"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The query matches with the term work but what would happen if we changed it to working? The query still matches because a search query is analyzed and during the analysis process the term `working` is stemmed to `work`. And this term was also stored within the inverted index. This means that we can effectively search for both the term work and working and still get a match. This makes the search engine more flexible because 2 words are so closely related. 

## Synonyms and stemmed words are still highlighted

```
GET /stemming_test/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "description": "enjoy work"
    }
  },
  "highlight": {
    "fields": {
      "description": {}
    }
  }
}
```
Response

```
{
  "took" : 10,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 0.7176595,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "stemming_test",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 0.7176595,
        "_source" : {
          "description" : "I love working for my firm!"
        },
        "highlight" : {
          "description" : [
            "I <em>love</em> <em>working</em> for my firm!"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
