## Mapping overview

In ES mapping is used to define how documents and their fields should be stored and indexed. The point of doing this, is to store and index data in a way that is appropriate the way how we want to search data. E.g. which fields should be treated as full text fields, which contain numbers, dates, or geo locations. 

### Dynamic mapping

Means no mapping is defined explicitely or at least not for some fields. When adding new docs, ES will automaticaly add mappings for any fields that do not have any fields yet. This is done by inspecting the types of values for a doc's fields. It is possible to define rules for dynamic mapping but that's not what you usualy do. 

`GET /products/_mapping`

Response 
```
{
  "products" : {
    "mappings" : {
      "properties" : {
        "created" : {
          "type" : "date",
          "format" : "yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss||yyyy/MM/dd||epoch_millis"
        },
        "description" : {
          "type" : "text",
          "fields" : {
            "keyword" : { <- this field has two mappings
              "type" : "keyword",
              "ignore_above" : 256
            }
          }
        },
        "in_stock" : {
          "type" : "long"
        },
        "is_active" : {
          "type" : "boolean"
        },
        "name" : {
          "type" : "text",
          "fields" : {
            "keyword" : {
              "type" : "keyword",
              "ignore_above" : 256
            }
          }
        },
        "price" : {
          "type" : "long"
        },
        "sold" : {
          "type" : "long"
        },
        "tags" : {
          "type" : "text",
          "fields" : {
            "keyword" : {
              "type" : "keyword",
              "ignore_above" : 256
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

By default each text field is mapped using both the "text" and "keyword" type. "Text" type is used for full text searches, and the "keyword" for exact matches, aggregations and such.

### Meta fields

There are 10 of them. We will take a look at some of them.

1. \_index. Contains the name of the index to which a document belongs. Added to docs automatically. This is used internaly when quering docs within an index but may also be used explicitely within search queries if searching for docs within multiple indices.
2. \_id is the doc id. Usualy you don't use it directly.
3. \_source contains the original JSON object that was passed to ES. The field is not indexed and therefore you cannot search it, but you can retrieve it. 
4. \_field_names contains the names of every field that contins a non-null value. This is used with a query named "exists" which matches docs that contain a non-null value for a given field. 
5. \_routing stores the value used to route a document to a shard. If using custom routing then this value is stored within the "\_routing" meta field.
6. \_versioning stores internal version of a doc. The value is simply an integer that starts at 1 and is incremented every time we change the doc.
7. \_meta can store custom data that is not touched in any way by ES. Store a whatever app specific data.
