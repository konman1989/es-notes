The first term contains a word "spaghetti" twice and the term "pasta" once which give it a high relevance score. The second doc only contains the term "Spaghetti". The reason for this is that the match query is a boolena query. What happens internally is that the terms are used for boolean query with the default operator `or`. Since the default operator is `or`, all terms do not need to appear in the field they were searching, but the more terms appear, the higher the relevance. This is usefull because we probably don't want to require filter words such as "with", "the" etc. to be present. That's because those words are not significant in terms of relevance and can differ based on who is writing the query. 

In most cases you want to leave the default `or` but it can be changed

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": {
        "query": "Recipes with pasta or spaghetti",
        "operator": "and"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
No results returned. With this approach, all the terms in the query must be present within a document field. 
```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": {
        "query": "pasta or spaghetti",
        "operator": "and"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Now we got 1 doc matched, having all 3 terms in the title.

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": {
        "query": "pasta spaghetti",
        "operator": "and"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
The document still matches because both terms appear within the title as the search term is analyzed the same way as when it was created.
