In match queries it does not mean what order the term appears, or if there are any other terms between the matching terms. But what if you wanted to match phrases, like terms in a specific order? This can be done with a `match_phrase` query.

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_phrase": {
      "title": "spaghetti puttanesca"
    }
  }
}
```
This query matches 1 document that begins with a phrase that we are searching for. If we switch the terms, there will be no results. So both terms must be in the query to match in this order without no terms in between.
