Searching within multiple fields in one query can be achieved by using a `multi_match` query. With this query we can specify an array of fields to search through.
```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match": {
      "query": "pasta",
      "fields": ["title", "description"]
    }
  }
}
```

The result shows that ES searches for both the "title" field and the "description" field though it is not necessary they both contain it. It is also possible to add a type in the query to control how the query is executed internally. But the default behavior is following:

Even though we're searching 2 fields a doc would probably be more relevant if the terms appear in the same field instead of one term in each field. By default docs containing the terms in any of the specified fields are matched but the relevant score from the best matching field is used. This means that if one of the fields contains both terms and the other field only contains one of them, then the relevant score for the first field is used for that document. What happens internally is that ES takes the terms and executes a match query for each one within the query named `dis_max`.
