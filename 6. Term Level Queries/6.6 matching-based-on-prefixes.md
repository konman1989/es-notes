Apart from matching docs that contain a given term for fields with the term query we can also look for terms to begin with a given prefix. Prefix query matches docs that contain a term within a given field that begins with a given prefix. This means that the query is not limited to searching fields containing a single term but it will also match a doc that has 10 words within the field, if any of the terms begin with the specified prefix.
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "prefix": {
      "tags.keyword": "Vege"
    }
  }
}
```
