Most parameters which accept a formatted date value — such as `gt` and `lt` in range queries, or `from` and `to` in daterange aggregations — understand date maths.

The expression starts with an anchor date, which can either be `now`, or a date string ending with `||`. This anchor date can optionally be followed by one or more maths expressions:
```
    +1h: Add one hour
    -1d: Subtract one day
    /d: Round down to the nearest day
```
The supported time units differ from those supported by time units for durations. The supported units are:
```
y - Years

M - Months

w - Weeks

d - Days

h - Hours

H - Hours

m - Minutes

s - Seconds 
```

Assuming `now` is 2001-01-01 12:00:00 (anchor date), some examples are:

```
now+1h - now in milliseconds plus one hour. Resolves to: 2001-01-01 13:00:00

now-1h - now in milliseconds minus one hour. Resolves to: 2001-01-01 11:00:00

now-1h/d - now in milliseconds minus one hour, rounded down to UTC 00:00. Resolves to: 2001-01-01 00:00:00

2001.02.01\|\|+1M/d - 2001-02-01 in milliseconds plus one month. Resolves to: 2001-03-01 00:00:00 
```

**If we use a date string (not `now`), we need to add 2 trailing pipe symbols.** It just to help ES to parse the string and has nothin in common with a logical 'or'.

The values can also be rounded, depening on the operator you use.

![date_round](https://github.com/konman1989/es-notes/blob/main/images/date_round.png)

```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "created": {
        "gte": "2010/01/01||-1y/M"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
We can also place the rounding at the beginning, if we wanted the rounding happend before adding or subtracting. From the anchor dates. 
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "created": {
        "gte": "2010/01/01||/M-1y"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
In this case since we use the `GTE` operator, the value will be rounded down.
