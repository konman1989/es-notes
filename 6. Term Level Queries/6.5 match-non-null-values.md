We will take a look at the docs that have at least 1 non-null field. A non-null value is simply any value that is not null. An empty array would not match an `exists` query clause, because an array with no values does not satisfy the definition of the `exists` query, which is that the field should have at least one non-null value. 
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "exists": {
      "field": "tags"
    }
  }
}
```

Scrolling through the results we should see that all of the matches have at least one tag. 

**How does the query work?**

ES uses `_field _name` meta field internally when fining documents that contain non-null value for a given field.
