## Searching for a term
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "is_active": true
    }
  }
}
```

Terms queries also support a more verbose structurer where the value for the key is an object. You can add moore options for greater control and the value key for the value to search for. 
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "is_active": {
        "value": true 
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Terms queries are used for enums, dates, booleans and for the fields of the type keyword, because these are not analyzed.

## Searching for multiple terms

This query shares the same characteristics as the term query only with the exception that the in searches for multiple terms instead of providing a single value we provide an array of values. The document will match if it contains any of the supplied values within the field that we specify. 

```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "terms": {
      "tags.keyword": [
        "Soup",
        "Cake"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In the result we will see the hits that contain both the "Soup" and the "Cake" tags. In simple words this query is similar ti the "IN" clause in SQL.
