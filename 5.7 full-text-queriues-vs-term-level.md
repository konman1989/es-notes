```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "name": "lobster"
    }
  }
}
```

If we execute this one, we get 5 hits, if execute the following, we get 0 hits:

```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "name": "lobster"
    }
  }
}
```

The only difference is because the term lobster is capitalized in the second query, even though the first hit contains the term "Lobster" capitalized. Let's look at the full text query:

```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "name": "Lobster"
    }
  }
}
```

Why does the "match query" match the doc when the "term query" does not? The reason is because ther is an essential difference betwen term queries and full text queries. Let's see on the diagrams below.
![term_query](https://github.com/konman1989/es-notes/blob/main/images/term_query.png)

First of all, term level queries search for exact queries. And since we are actually searching in the inverted index that went through the standard analyzer, it has been lowercased. And they match because both terms are lowercased.

![term_uppercase](https://github.com/konman1989/es-notes/blob/main/images/term_uppercase.png)

The same is not the case for the second query since we are searching for the rerm "Lobster".  
![match_query](https://github.com/konman1989/es-notes/blob/main/images/match_query.png)

The reason is, that unlike term level queries, full text queries are analyzed. This means that the search query goes through the same analysis process as when the doc was created. For this particular query, it means that the capitalized term "Lobster" is lowercased as part of the standard analyzer and compared to the term in the inverted inex, we have a match. 

This is important thing to understand: **term level queries search for exact queries, and are not analyzed. Whereas full text queries are analyzed, using the same analyser thats's defined for the field**. So if we use a full text query using a different analyzer than the field has, the document will not be matched. 

## Summary

Full text queries are analyzed by the same analyzer as was used for the inverted index. At least, that's the default behaviour. 
The same is not the case for the term level queries, which are not analyzed. This is why term level queries are not suited to perform full text searches. Instead, term queries are better suited for matching enum values, numbers, dates etc.
