## Overview

* not a revision history of documents
* ES stores an \_version metadata fiels with every doc
  - the value is an integeer
  - it is incremented by one when modifying a document
  - the value is retained for 60 seconds when deleting a document (configured with the `index.gc_deletes` setting)

### Types of versioning

* the default versioning type is called internal versioning
* there is also an external versioning type
  - useful when versions are mainainted outside of ES
  - when documents are also stored in a RDBMS

### What is the point of vrsioning

* you can tell how many times a document has been modified
* versioning is hardly used anymore, and is mostly a thing from the past
* it was previously the way to do optimistic concurrency control
