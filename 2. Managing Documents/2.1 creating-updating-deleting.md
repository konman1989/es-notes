{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 2,
    "number_of_replicas": 2
  }
}
```

## Index documents
```
POST /products/\_doc 
{
  "name": "Coffe Maker",
  "price": 64,
  "in_stock": 10
}
```
Response:
```
{
  "_index" : "products",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "QU-OKHoBr7ZL9mRAzonZ",
  "_version" : 1,
  "result" : "created",
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 3,
    "successful" : 1,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 0,
  "_primary_term" : 1
}
```
Why 3 shards? We allocated 2 primary shards and 2 repclica shards. The doc was added to 1 primary shard and replicated to 2 replica shards.

\_id was created automatically, but we can add our custom name.
```
PUT /products/\_doc/100 
{
  "name": "Toaster",
  "price": 49,
  "in_stock": 4,
}
```
Response
```
{
  "_index" : "products",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "100",
  "_version" : 1,
  "result" : "created",
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 3,
    "successful" : 1,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 0,
  "_primary_term" : 1
}
```
We don't have to specify the index in advance, there is a setting named `action.auto_create_index` that can be configured at the cluster level, which specifices if indices should be created automatically. The setting is default to "true", meaning that if we try to add a document to a non-existing index, the index will be created, after which the document will be added to it. It's best practice to explicitely create indices, but this behavior is convenient in a dev mode.

## Retrieve documents by IDs

GET /products/_doc/100

Response
```
{
  "_index" : "products",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "100",
  "_version" : 1,
  "_seq_no" : 0,
  "_primary_term" : 1,
  "found" : true,
  "_source" : {
    "name" : "Toaster",
    "price" : 49,
    "in_stock" : 4
  }
}
```
If not found:
```
{
  "_index" : "products",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "1000",
  "found" : false <- false, and no "_source" field
}
```
## Update documents
```
POST /products/_update/100
{
  "doc": {
    "in_stock": 3
  }
}
```
Response
```
{
  "_index" : "products",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "100",
  "_version" : 2,
  "result" : "updated", <- "noop", if not result a change e.g. if we supplied the same value
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 3,
    "successful" : 1,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 1,
  "_primary_term" : 1
}
```
To add a new field, just run the same query with the field name
```
POST products/_update/100
{
  "doc": {
    "tags": ["electronics"]
  }
}
```
Response 
```
{
  "_index" : "products",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "100",
  "_version" : 3,
  "result" : "updated",
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 3,
    "successful" : 1,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 2,
  "_primary_term" : 1
}
```
### How it works under the hood

* ES documents are immutable (!). Docs cannot be changed. We replace them! The Update API took care of a couple of things for us. It retrieved the doc, changed the fields according to our specification and reindexed the document with the same id, replacing it.
* The field values are changed
* The existing doc is replaced with the modified doc
* We could do the exact same thing at the app level by first retrieving the existing doc then modify its fields and replace it.

## Scripted updates

ES supports scripting which enables you to write custom logic while acessing a document's values. 
```
POST /products/_update/100
{
  "script": {
    "source": "ctx._source.in_stock--"
  }
}
```
`ctx` is a variable and is short for "context". We can access the source document through its "\_source" property which gives us an object containing the document's fields. In this case, we access the "in_stock" field and subsctucted from it. (++ to increase)

We can also do assignments, so let's assign a value of ten to the field
```
POST products/_update/100
{
  "script": {
    "source": "ctx._source.in_stock = 10"
  }
}
```
We can add parameters to the query. 
```
POST /products/_update/100
{
  "script": {
    "source": "ctx._source.in_stock -= params.quantity",
    "params": {
      "quantity": 4
    }
  }
}
``` 
For scripting updates, the response fied "result" wil always be "updated" (no "noop"). There is an exeption though:
```
POST /products/_update/100
{
  "script": {
    "source": """
    if ctx._source.in_stock == 0) {
      ctx.op = 'noop';
    } 
    
    ctx._source.in_stock--;
    """"
  }
}
```
With this approach we can add some extra logic, e.g. if the product qty becomes 0, we can set "ctx.op = 'delete'".

## Upserts

Upserting means to conditionally update or insert a document based on whether or not the document already exists. If the doc exists the script is run and if it doesn't, a new document is indexed.
```
POST /products/_update/101
{
  "script": {
    "source": "ctx._source.in_stock++""
  },
  "upsert": {
    "name": "Blender",
    "price": 399,
    "in_stock": 5
  }
}
```
Response
```
{
  "_index" : "products",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "101",
  "_version" : 1,
  "result" : "created", <- means the doc was created
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 3,
    "successful" : 1,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 7,
  "_primary_term" : 1
}
```
Since no doc with an ID of 101 already existed, the contents of the "upsert" option should have been indexed as a new document. We can verify this by inspecting the query results and the "result" key in particular. This key contains a value of "created" meaning that the query caused a new document to be created.

If we run the same query again, it'll return "result" : "updated" and the "in_stock" field will be increased to 6.


## Replace documents
```
PUT /products/_doc/100
{
  "name": "Toaster",
  "price": 49,
  "in_stock": 4
}
```
Response
```
{
  "_index" : "products",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "100",
  "_version" : 8,
  "result" : "updated",
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 3,
    "successful" : 1,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 9,
  "_primary_term" : 1
}
```
The doc now contains all the fields that we specified and the "tags" field is gone because the whole document was replaced by the one we supplied in the query.

## Delete documents

DELETE /products/_doc/101

Response
```
{
  "_index" : "products",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "101",
  "_version" : 3,
  "result" : "deleted",
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 3,
    "successful" : 1,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 11,
  "_primary_term" : 1
}
```
