## TF/IDF (Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency)

**This one has been replaced by new Okapi BM25 algorithm.**

### Term Frequency (TF)

Calculates how many times the term appears in the field for a given document. The more times the term appears, the more relevant the doc is. Suppose we have a title containing a term "salad" that we are searching for. So it calculates how many times this term appears in this field. The more times appeared, the higher the relevance score. 

### Inverse Document Frequency (IDF))

How ofthen the term appears within the index (i.e. across all docs). The more often the term appears, the lower the score and relevance. It means that if the word appears a lot within an index it is considered to be less significant. The example is words the, this, is if etc.

### Field-length norm

Calculates how long the field is. The longer the field, the less likely the word in the field is relevant. For example, the term "salad" is more significant in a field of 50 characters, then 5000 characters.

**These 3 fields are calculated and stored in the index every time the document is added or updated**

## BM25 algorithm

It is better at handling stop words. Stop words are the words that appear many times in docs and provide little input as to how relevant the doc is in the search query. It used to be a common practise to remove stop words when analyzing the fields. But without removing them, we need to somehow handle them otherwise their relevance will be boosted. 

BM25 solves stop words problem by using `Nonlinear Term Frequency Saturation`

The idea is that BM25 has an upper limit for how much the term can be boosted based on how many times it occures. If a term appears 5-10 times, it has a significantly larger impact on the relevance than if it just occured once or twice. But as the number of occurances increses, the relevance boost quickly becomes less significant, meaning that the boost of the term appearing 1000 times will be the same as if it occured 30 times. 

It also improved the **field-length norm factor.** Instead of treating the fields the same way across all docs, the BM25 considers each field separately. It does this by taking an avarage field length into account, meaning that it can distinguish short title fields from long title fields. 

## Notes

It is also possible to change how ES calculates the scores. 

By adding a field `"explain": true`, we can check some usefull information on relevance.
