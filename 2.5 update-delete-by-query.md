## Multiple update

It is similar how we do it in RDBs using UPDATE WHERE

The query uses three concepts that we have just covered: primary terms, sequence numbers, optimistic concurrency control.
```
POST products/_update_by_query
{
  "script": {
    "source": "ctx._source.in_stock--"
  },
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
```
Response
```
{
  "took" : 1196,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "total" : 3,
  "updated" : 3,
  "deleted" : 0,
  "batches" : 1,
  "version_conflicts" : 0,
  "noops" : 0,
  "retries" : {
    "bulk" : 0,
    "search" : 0
  },
  "throttled_millis" : 0,
  "requests_per_second" : -1.0,
  "throttled_until_millis" : 0,
  "failures" : [ ]
}
```
### Summary

* the query creates a snapshot to do optimistic concurrency control
* search queries and bulk requests are sent to replication groups sequentually
  - ES retries these queries up to ten times
  - if the queries still fail, the whole query will be aborted (any changes already made to documents, are not rolled back)
* the API returns information abut failures

## Delete by query
```
POST products/_delete_by_query
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
```

## Bulk API
```
POST _bulk (all in one line)
{ "index": { "_index": "products", "_id": 200 } }
{ "name": "Espresso Machine", "price": 199, "in_stock": 5 }
{ "create": { "_index": "products", "_id": 201 } }
{ "name": "Milk Frother",  "price": 149, "in_stock": 14 }
```
Response
```
{
  "took" : 724,
  "errors" : false,
  "items" : [
    {
      "index" : {
        "_index" : "products",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "200",
        "_version" : 1,
        "result" : "created",
        "_shards" : {
          "total" : 3,
          "successful" : 1,
          "failed" : 0
        },
        "_seq_no" : 4,
        "_primary_term" : 1,
        "status" : 201
      }
    },
    {
      "create" : {
        "_index" : "products",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "201",
        "_version" : 1,
        "result" : "created",
        "_shards" : {
          "total" : 2,
          "successful" : 1,
          "failed" : 0
        },
        "_seq_no" : 0,
        "_primary_term" : 1,
        "status" : 201
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
Or we can request /products
```
POST products/_bulk
{ "update": { "_id": 200} }
{ "doc": { "price": 129 } }
{ "delete": { "_id": "QU-OKHoBr7ZL9mRAzonZ"} }
```
Response
```
{
  "took" : 27,
  "errors" : false,
  "items" : [
    {
      "update" : {
        "_index" : "products",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "200",
        "_version" : 2,
        "result" : "updated",
        "_shards" : {
          "total" : 3,
          "successful" : 1,
          "failed" : 0
        },
        "_seq_no" : 5,
        "_primary_term" : 1,
        "status" : 200
      }
    },
    {
      "delete" : {
        "_index" : "products",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "QU-OKHoBr7ZL9mRAzonZ",
        "_version" : 3,
        "result" : "deleted",
        "_shards" : {
          "total" : 3,
          "successful" : 1,
          "failed" : 0
        },
        "_seq_no" : 6,
        "_primary_term" : 1,
        "status" : 200
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
### Things to be aware of

* HTTP Content-Type header should be set `Content-Type: application/x-ndjson`
* application/json accepted but that's not the correct way
* the console tool handles this for us
* each line must end with a newline character (\n or \r\n)
* a failed action will not affect other actions
* the bulk API returns detailed information about each action

### When to use the Bulk API

* when you need to perform lots of write operations at the same time (importing data or modifying lots of data)
* the Bulk API is more efficient than sending individual write requests
