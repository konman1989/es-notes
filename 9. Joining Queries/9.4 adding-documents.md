Let's add some departments to the index

```
PUT /department/_doc/1
{
  "name": "Development",
  "join_field": "department" <- key from mapping
}

PUT /department/_doc/2
{
  "name": "Marketing",
  "join_field": "department"
}
```

Let's add some employees

```
PUT /department/_doc/3
{
  "name": "Bob Smith",
  "age": 27,
  "gender": "M",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 1
  }
}
```

If we try to run this query, we get an error `"[routing] is missing for join field [join_field]"`. By default ES uses the doc id as the routing value. So we need to add a routing (doc) id. The reason for this is because the parent and the child docs must be stored in the same shard. 

```
PUT /department/_doc/3?routing=1
{
  "name": "Bob Smith",
  "age": 27,
  "gender": "M",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 1
  }
}
```
