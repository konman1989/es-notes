## Mapping document relationships

Since we change the mapping, we need to delete the index before. The way we can join docs in ES is by using a special kind of field called `joined_field`. This field defines the relations between the types of docs that are part of the doc hierarchy. 

```
PUT /department
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "join_field": { 
        "type": "join",
        "relations": {
          "department": "employee" "employee" <- key-value relations
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
We have just defined 2 relation types being department and employee, where department is the parent of employee. We defined parent-child relationships which we can make use of when adding documents. But we could have also defined multiple children. For this, we would have to change the string value to the array of strings instead.
