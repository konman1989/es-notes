## The documents we join must be stored within the same index

This means that we cannot have departments in one index and employees in another and then try to join the 2 together. This is a performance limitation as joins would otherwise be really slow.

## Parent & child docs must be on the same shard

Because we have to explicitely provide a `routing` parameter to make sure that the docs ended up on the same shard. On top of that there can only be one join field per index. A join field can have as many relations as you want. New relations can be added after creating the index. Child relations can only be added to existing parents. A doc can only have one parent. This means that an employee can only belong to one department. A doc can, however have multiple children, so a department can have mmultiple emmployees.
