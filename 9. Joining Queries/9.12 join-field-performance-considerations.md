## Using join fields is slow. 

Join queries are expensive in term of performance and should be avoided whenever possible. There a few exceptions. The more child docs poointing to unique parents, the slower the `has_child` query is. Basically, the more docs, the slower the query. The same applies for `has_parent` query. If you use mulltilevel relations, then each level of doc relations adds on overhead to queries. 

In some scenarios the performance of join fields won't be bad. That's when you have a one to many relationship between 2 doc types, where one type has many mmore docs than the other. E.g. recipes as parent docs and ingridients as child docs. 

Also if you have a limited # of docs and won't have it anytime soon, performancce will be fine. 

**If join fields are bad, how do we map docs relationships?**

Consider using nested data type. Generally speaking, you should not need doc relationships. ES is efficient for searching loats of data, but it's different then a relational DB.
