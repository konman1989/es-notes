The basic usage of the term query looks up docs that contain one or more terms that we specify in the query. But sometimes we might want to look up so many terms that is not feasable to include themm in the query definition explicitly. For example, if you want to include 500 terms. For that reason the terms query support something called a term lookup mechanism that's just really fancy ES jargon for fetching the terms from a doc.

Essentially what this lets us do is to specify an index type or an identifier of a doc from which we want to retrieve terms. We also need to spacify the path of the field in which the terms are stored. 

```
GET /stories/_search
{
  "query": {
    "terms": {
      "user": { <- key should be the name of the field that contains the user id of the story which is user in this case
        "index": "users", <- we need to define where ES should retrieve the user ID from. 
        "id": "1",
        "path": "following" <- contains an array of user IDs but it could have been mapped as nested objects
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Response

```
{
  "took" : 31,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 2,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "stories",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "user" : 3,
          "content" : "Wow look, a penguin!"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "stories",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "6",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "user" : 2,
          "content" : "Chilling at the beach @ Greece #vacation #goodtimes"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In the response we get all stories docs that belong to the users, the user with id = 1 is subscribed to. 

So what happens here? When the coordinating node received a search request, it passed it and based on the options we specified it determined that it needed to retrieve the terms to be able to fulfill the terms query. As a result, it sent off a get request to retireve the doc with the id specified (`GET /users/_doc/1`). And so the value of the `following` field and fed it to the terms query. So essentially this is the same as first looking up the user by ID at the application level and then taking the value of the following fields and use that for terms query. 

Well, **it's conceptually the same** but not quite the same if we were to do this ath the application level.

In the app lavel we would be hitting the ES cluster with two queries instead of one. The time it takes ES to pass a query is very limited. So the difference is **mainly data transfer and network latency** which means how mmuch time it takes to send the query over the network. There is some network latency although ES cluster is hopefully running close to the app server geographically. More important though is how much data would be transferred over the network because this impacts perfomrance as well. Whatever the case, it is more efficient to let ES do this internally. 

Performance factors include the mapping and how much data there is. The more terms, the slower the query. ES has a term limit of apprx. 65k terms.
