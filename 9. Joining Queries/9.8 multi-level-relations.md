So far we've been only working with one level of relations. But it's also possible to have so-called multilevel on nested relations. In the context of what we've been working so far, we could have a company containing departmens which in turn have employees:

```
employee -> department -> company
```
We're going to create a new index and add one more relation supplier:

```
employee -> department -> company <- supplier
```

```
PUT /company
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "join_field": {
        "type": "join",
        "relations": {
          "company": [
              "department", "supplier" <- "company" is the parent relation for both the department and supplier relations
            ],
            "department": "employee" <- we define that a company can have multiple employees
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Let's add some more docs.

```
PUT /company/_doc/1
{
  "name": "My Company Inc.",
  "join_field": "company"
}
```

```
PUT /company/_doc/2?routing=1
{
  "name": "Development",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "department",
    "parent": 1
  }
}
```

```
PUT /company/_doc/3?routing=1 <- employee is a grand child of a company, so we need to specify its id ("My Company Inc."). The document needs to be routed to the correct shard. 
{
  "name": "Bob Smith",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 2 <- _doc id 2 ("Development")
  }
}
```

When usong multiple levels of relations you need to route to the shard that contains the doc at the highest level of the doc hierarchy. 

## Searching

Let's add more docs

```
PUT /company/_doc/4
{
  "name": "Another Company Inc.",
  "join_field": "company"
}

PUT /company/_doc/5?routing=4
{
  "name": "Marketing",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "department",
    "parent": 4
  }
}

PUT /company/_doc/6?routing=4
{
  "name": "Sue Lu",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 5
  }
}
```

Let's run the search query

```
GET /company/_search
{
  "query": {
    "has_child": { <- finds any company that contains departments that mathces query. 
      "type": "department",
      "query": {
        "has_child": { <- finds employees with name "Sue Lu"
          "type": "employee",
          "query": {
            "term": {
              "name.keyword": "Sue Lu"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
