```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
          "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        },
        {
          "range": {
            "preparation_time_minutes": {
              "lte": 15
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

 The queries within a `must` key must be satisfied for documents to match the query. But it is also important that the docs will contribute to the docs relevant score. This means that while a document must be matched by our queries within the "must" objects, it's also scored by how well it matches those queries. 
 
 It makes no sense to calculate how well the doc is satisfied within a range query. It is just a "yes" or "no" question. Instead of keeping the query within the "must" array, we should move it within the filter object. While ES is smart enough to just apply a constant score of 1 to the range query when it's placed within the must array, the filter object has an edge in terms of performance. The fiter object is for queries that either match or they don't, i.e. ther is no such thing as how well the match. More precisely, queries within this object are running in a filter context as opposed to the query contetxt. Caching is where filter queries have an edge because the query clauses can be cached for subsequent queries. This is because the result of the query directly depends on the query and the documents, there is no notion on how well the documents match. 
 
 ```
 GET /recepies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
          "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        }
      ],
      "filter": [
        {
          "range": {
            "preparation_time_minutes": {
              "lte": 15
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

We get the exact same match as before with the only difference - the score is exactly 1 point lower.

Let's filter out some docs

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
          "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        }
      ],
      "must_not": [
        {
          "match": {
          "ingredients.name": "tuna"
          }
        }
      ], 
      "filter": [
        {
          "range": {
            "preparation_time_minutes": {
              "lte": 15
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
The queris within `must_not` objects are executed in the filtered context, exactly as with the filter objects. Scoring is therefore ignored and the score of 0 is returned for all documents. And they are also considered for caching. Althoug it is for ES to decide wheter to catch or not so there is no guarantee that a query will be cached. 

Now we want to rank some docs that conain some term higher. We can do it with the `should` object.

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
          "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        }
      ],
      "must_not": [
        {
          "match": {
          "ingredients.name": "tuna"
          }
        }
      ],
      "should": [
        {
          "match": {
          "ingredients.name": "parsley"
          }
        }
      ], 
      "filter": [
        {
          "range": {
            "preparation_time_minutes": {
              "lte": 15
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The results of the `should` query is a bit special. It basically means that queries within it boost a score if they match, but they are not required to match. So the recepies with word "parsley" is likely to score higher than one without "parsley". This is no guarantee as it depends on how well other queries match too. `should` query speaks for itself, I prefer the results to have this term, but I don't require for it to have it. You can also add `minimum_should_mathc` parameter which allows to define how many should clauses must match. 

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
          "ingredients.name": "pasta"
          }
        }
      ],
      "should": [
        {
          "match": {
          "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
This query is similar to the previous one although a bit simpler. It matches recipes with past as an ingredient and gives a relevance boost to recipes with "parmesan". 

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        {
          "match": {
          "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
If we remove the `must` object, we get the same number of matches but there is an important difference since we no longer have a must or filter object, at least one should query must match. In this case we have 1 query clause so this means that recipes must contain parmesan. It want from being optional and boosting relevance score to being required.
