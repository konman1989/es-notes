It internally uses a boolean `or` with an option to change it to `and`. It does this as part of the analysis process after the query has been analyzed by the field analyzer. The tokens resulting from the analyzis process are added to a bool query as term queries. This means that the match query is just a convenient wrapper around the bool query that simplifies writing common queries. It means that you can just throw a search query directly at ES instead to having first to tokenize the query in your application. 

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "pasta carbonara"
    }
  }
}
```
Let's write this out explicitely, so we can see both querires. 

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        {
          "term": {
            "title": "pasta"
          }
        },
        {
          "term": {
            "title": "carbonara"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
The results are the same.
```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": {
        "query": "pasta carbonara",
        "operator": "and"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
What's the equivalent of this query? A bool query with each term transated into a term query within a `must` object. 

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "term": {
            "title": "pasta"
          }
        },
        {
          "term": {
            "title": "carbonara"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Just as with the bool query, the match query also accepts `minimum_should_match` parameter where you can configure how many of the `should` clauses must match. This parameter is simply passed to the bool query during the analysis process. 

The only thing we need to keep in mind, that match queries go through the analysis process while term queries do not. So if we change a title to a capital letter in the term above, we'll get no results.
