There are 2 characters that you can make use of being an asterisk and the question mark.
 
## Asterisk
 
Matches any character sequences including no characters 
 
## Question mark

Matches any single character

```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "wildcard": {
      "tags.keyword": "Veg*ble"
    }
  }
}
```

This query will return the docs starting with "Veg" and ending with "ble". There might be any characters between them and any number, including 0.
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "wildcard": {
      "tags.keyword": "Veg?ble"
    }
  }
}
```
No results returned because the "?" mathces any single character. 

## Performance

Whildcard queries can be slow because it needs to iterate over a lot of terms. Something you should be careful with is placing wildcards ath the beginning of a term. If you place an "\*" or "?" at the beginning, this can lead to extremely slow queries, so you should avoid this.
