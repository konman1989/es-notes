We can control the maximum # of hits that are returned from a search query. We can do it by either adding a size query param or by adding a size param within the body when using the query DSL. 

```
GET /recepies/_search?size=2
{
  "_source": false, 
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "pasta"
    }
  }
}
```

Only 2 results are returned, however the hits # is still 9. 

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "_source": false, 
  "size": 2, 
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "pasta"
    }
  }
}
```

**he default size is 10**
