By default the whole content of the field is returned. The motivation for limiting what is returned for the `_source` field would usually be to reduce the amount of data that's returned and thereby thransferred on the network. So usually the motivation is to improve performance. In some cases you can remove the `_source` field in case you just need to get the docs ids. 

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "_source": false, 
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "pasta"
    }
  }
}
```

No `_source` key in the response. We can also specify the field names we want to include.

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "_source": "created", 
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "pasta"
    }
  }
}
```
```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "_source": ["created", "title"], 
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "pasta"
    }
  }
}
```

To get all nested object's fields, we can specify the following:

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "_source": "ingredients.*", 
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "pasta"
    }
  }
}
```

We can also exclude keys

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "_source": {
    "includes": "ingredients.*",
    "excludes": "ingredients.name"}, 
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "pasta"
    }
  }
}
```
