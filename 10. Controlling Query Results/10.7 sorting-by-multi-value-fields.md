We can sort by fields containing more than one value such as the ratings field within the recipe index. 

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "_source": "ratings",
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  },
  "sort": [
    {
      "ratings": {
        "order": "desc",
        "mode": "sum"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
This is aggregation.
