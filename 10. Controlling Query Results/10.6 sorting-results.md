Sorting results is quete easy in ES and it is almost the same as working with `order by` in SQL. 

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "_source": false, 
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "pasta"
    }
  },
  "sort": [
    {
      "preparation_time_minutes": {
        "order": "desc"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Response

```
{
  "took" : 9,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 9,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "recepies",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "2",
        "_score" : null,
        "sort" : [
          30
        ]
      },
      {
      ...
 ```
 
 We have a new field name sort. This is an array of the values that the results were sorted by. 
 
 ```
 GET /recepies/_search
{
  "_source": "created", 
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "pasta"
    }
  },
  "sort": [
    {
      "created": {
        "order": "desc"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Response

```
{
  "took" : 6,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 9,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "recepies",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : null,
        "_source" : {
          "created" : "2017/03/29"
        },
        "sort" : [
          1490745600000
        ]
      },
      {
        "_index" : "recepies",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "19",
        "_score" : null,
        "_source" : {
          "created" : "2015/02/14"
        },
        "sort" : [
          1423872000000
        ]
      },
      {
        "_index" : "recepies",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "2",
        "_score" : null,
        "_source" : {
          "created" : "2014/12/19"
        },
        "sort" : [
          1418947200000
        ]
      },
      ...
      
```

We included `created` field, because in case with date fields, the sort includes the # of milliseconds since the epoch. 

Let's try to sort by multiple fields.

```
GET /recepies/_search
{
  "_source": ["preparation_time_minutes", "created"], 
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "pasta"
    }
  },
  "sort": [
    { "preparation_time_minutes": "asc"},
    {
      "created": {
        "order": "desc"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`preparation_time_minutes` is the first param, so it starts from it.
