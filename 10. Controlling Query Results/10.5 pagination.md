To do the pagination we need to start with the # of the search results available. 

```
total_pages = ceil(total_hits / page_size)
```

To go from one page to another we need to specify the `from` param

```
from = (page_size * (page_number - 1))
```

It is limited to 10k results. The reason for this that when performing deep page pagination, requests take up more and more heap memory and requests take longer. It is usually not a problemm, but it might be an issue if you need search issues to crawl deeper. For this you need a `search_after` param. 

It does not work the way it works for relational DBs with their cursor concept. When ES returns the results, it is completely done with it. Each query is stateless. So the results are always up to date. If the user gets results on the 1st page, and in a minute navigates to the 2d page when the new doc was added, they could see the same results on the 2d page. It's different from the cursor, since it does not change since it was created.
