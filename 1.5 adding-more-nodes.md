## Overview (for dev purposes)

Best practice is to run each node on a separate VM or container. 

### Approach 1

1. Download & extract ES
2. Configure the cluster and node names
3. Start up ES
4. We can specify the name in the "elasticsearch.yml" within the config directory along with the cluster name.

### Approach 2

1. Reuse an exisiting ES directory.
2. Startup ES, overwriting the following settings in the command line:
  a. cluster.name
  b. node.name
  c. path.data
  d. path.logs
  
  `elasticsearch -Enode.name=node-2 -Epath.data=./node-2/data -Epath.logs=./node-2/logs`
  
 This is not the best approach as in this case the 2d node does not have its own directory. This approach is OK for dev purposes.
 
 ## Node roles
 
 ### Master role `node.master: true|false`
 
 * Master role. The node may be elected as the cluster's master node
 * Master node is responsible for creating and deleting indeces
 * A node with this role will not automaticaly become the master node (unless there are no other master-eligible nodes))
 * For large clusters it is usefull to have dedicated master nodes

### Data node `node.data: true|false`

* Enables a node to store a part of the cluster's data
* Storing data includes performing queries related to that data, such as search queries
* Useful for having dedicated master nodes
* Used as part of configuring a dedicated master node

### Ingest node `node.ingest: true|false`

* Enables a node to run ingest pipelines
* Ingest pipelines are a series of steps that are performed when indexing documents
* Ingesting refers to adding a document to an index
* A simplified ver. of Logstash, directly within ES
* The role is mainly usefull for having dedicated ingest nodes


### Coordination node

`node.master: false`
`node.data: false`
`node.ingest: false`

* Coordination refers to the distribution of queries and the aggregation of results
* Usefult for coordinatiion-only nodes (for large clusters)
* Configured by disabling all other roles


### Voting-only `node.voting: true|false`

* Rarely used, you almost won't use it
* A node will participate in the voting for a new master node
* The node cannot be elected as the master node itself
* Only used for large clusters
