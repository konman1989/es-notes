## Overview

Data types can be divided into 4 categories

1. Core data types
2. Coomplex data types
3. Geo data types
4. Specialized data types

### Core data types

* text data type. Used to index full-text value such as descriptions. Values are analyzed. Due to the nature of full-text fields, they are rarely used for sorting and aggregating docs. That's something that is typically accomplished with "keyword" fields. Such fields also contain text, but not "full text". Keyword fields are not analyzed. Basically this means that values are stored exactly as defined at the time of adding docs to an index whereas "text" fields are stored in a way that is optimal for performing full-text searches. A couple of examples of "keyword" fields would be a "categoory" or "tags" field. For a "category" field a comon thing to do would be to filter docs to find all of the products within a give category.
* numeric data types. Float, short, long, half_float, byte, scaled_float. Byte is used for integer values betwen -128 and 127, so very low numbers and smaler numbers than the "short" data type. scaled_float is basically a floating point but is stored as long internally. 
* date. Represents dates as either a string,, long, or integer. It can be string, and integer representing the number of seconds since the epoch, or finally as a long, representing the miliseconds since the epoch. The string value for the format can be configured otherwise a default format will be used.
* boolean
* binary. Accepts a  Base64 encoded binary value. Not stored by default. 
* range data type. Used for range values such as date ranges or numeric ranges. You use it by using the keywords "gt", "gte", "lt" and "lte". `{ "gte": 10, "lte": 20 }`

### Coomplex data types

Data types that are not primitive, but are more complex in nature, e.g. arrays and objects
* object. Added as JSON objects; stored as key-value pairs internally. May contain nested objects.
 Index time
 ```
 {
    "name": {
      "firstName": "Bob",
      "lastName": "Sinclar"
     },
     "profession": "Developer"
  }
  ```
  
  Stored
  ```
  {
    "name.firstName": "Bob",
    "name.lastName": "Sinclar",
    "profession": "Developer"
  }
  ```
* array. Not an actual data type, because each field may contain multiple values by default.
    `[1, 2, 3]`
    `["one", "two", "three"]`
    ~~["one", 2, "three"]~~
    `[1, [2, 3]] -> [1, 2, 3]`
    
    Nested arrays are flatterned, arrays must be of the same data type. If you don't specify the type explicitely, then the type of the 1st value will be used as the array data type.
    
    You can store an array of objects,but associations between object values are lost!
    ```
    {
      "people": [
      {"name": "Bob", "age": 27},
      {"name": "Steve", "age": 13}
    ]
    }  
    ```
    Becomes
    ```
    {
      "people.name": ["Bob", "Steve"],
      "people.age": [27, 13]
    }
    ```
    You cannot query individual objects independently of the other objects in the array. It is because Lucene has no concept of inner objects. 
    What if we want to search for a person named "Bob" and age 27? We can't and in fact the results will be wrong. The solution for this is a data type named "nested".
    
* nested. Specialied version of the object data type. Enables arrays of objects to be queried independently of each other. When indexing this data type each object is indexed is a hidden document, ensuring each object is independent. You only ned to use "nested" queries. What happens when running nested queries, is that they are executed against nested documents which is actualy the case internaly.
  
  
### Geo data types
 
Used for geo data, like lattitude and longitude pairs. 
 
* geo-point data type. Accepts lat-lot pairs
* geo-shape data type. Used for more complex geo data (point, polygon, linestring, multipoint etc.)

### Specialized data types

Have a very specific purpose, such as storing IP addresses, attachments etc. 

* ip data type. Stores IPv4 and IPv6 IP addresses. 
* completion data type. Used to provide auto-completion ("search-as-you-type") functionality. Optimized for quick lookups. It is done by something caled suggesters.
* Attachment data type. Requires the Ingest Attachment Processor Plugin. Used to make text from varioous document formats searchable (e.g. PPT, PDF, RTF, ...). Uses Apache Tika internally for text recognition.

`sudo bin/elasticsearch-plugin install ingetst-attachment`
